## ⚙️ Getting Started
This project demonstrates how NLP and ML models can be used to analyze text and generate insights.  
To replicate:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the pipeline on sample data.
4. Analyze sentiment outputs and visualize results.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

InsightFlow AI is designed with a modular architecture that combines text preprocessing, NLP models, and visualization modules.

### Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text to prepare it for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies machine learning and transformer-based NLP models to classify sentiment.
- **Visualization**: Generates charts and graphs to summarize sentiment trends.
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Ensures scalable and reproducible execution for datasets of any size.

### Workflow
1. **Data Input** → Text files or datasets are loaded into the pipeline.  
2. **Preprocessing** → Text is cleaned, tokenized, and normalized.  
3. **Sentiment Classification** → NLP models predict positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.  
4. **Visualization & Reporting** → Results are visualized and exported for analysis.  
5. **Insights Delivery** → Actionable insights are ready for stakeholders or further integration.
